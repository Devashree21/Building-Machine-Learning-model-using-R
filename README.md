# Building-Machine-Learning-model-using-R

Here is a short FAQ about this repository

**1) What is this repository about?**

In this repository, we are going to build a machine learning model using R for classification problem.

**2) Why R?**

R is a popular open-source data science programming language. It has strong visualization features, which are necessary for exploring data before applying any machine learning algorithm and evaluating its output. Many R packages for machine learning are commercially accessible, and many modern statistical learning methods are implemented in R.

**3) Which dataset has been used?**

We will be using the Stroke Prediction dataset from Kaggle, which has 5110 observations and 12 variables.

Details of this tutorial and model setup are discussed in my article https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2022/06/build-a-step-by-step-machine-learning-model-using-r/ published on Analytics Vidhya.
